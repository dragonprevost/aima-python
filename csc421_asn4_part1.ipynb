The classification problem can then be expressed as setting all the variables corresponding to the features as evidence and querying the probability for the class. Express the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier you implemented in the previous assignment as a Bayesian Network using the probability.ipynb conventions. Now that you have a DBN express and solve the classification problem as a query and go over all the previous steps for this particular problem. More specifically do exact inference by enumeration, exact inference by variable elimination, approximate inference by rejection sampling and approximate inference by likelihood weighting to answer the query and show the results.
