    "In this assignment we will explore search algorithm using a Block World consisting of a width by height grid of \n",
    "cells. That way you can reuse the ipythonblocks code from agents.ipynb and agents.py for visualization. A Block World navigation problem consists of finding a path from a starting location on the grid to a destination location of the grid. In each square/cell the search agent can move in 4 directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) except the edges in which one of these directions is not available depending on which side of the grid the agent is on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest version of this problem the search agent just has to go from the starting cell to the destination cell and a solution is the sequence of actions required. Note that for this particular problem search algoithms are overkill and instead a very simple algorithm can be used to find immediately a solution. One can take the difference of the x-coordinates and then move the appropriate number of LEFT or RIGHT steps and similarly take the difference of the y-coodinates and then move the appropriate number of UP and DOWN steps. However implementing search algorithms for this problem will help you understand the concepts better and is also needed \n",
    "for the more complex version of the problem which includes obstacles. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the obstacle version of the problem you are also provided with the location of a number of squares (expressed as (x,y) coordinates that act as obstacles. For example if there is an obstacle at a particular location then the agent will not be able to move to that location. Now a solution is a sequence of actions that takes our agents from the starting location to the destination location that also avoids any obstacles. \n",

Change the code so that the frontier gets printed as the search algorithm iterates. For debugging purposes you can start with the Romania example first but in the final solution you should show how the frontier changes for a particular instances of the BlockWorld problem. Use the following dimensions: a 10 by 10 grid with a starting location of (0,1) and a destination location of (7,8). Notice that in our BlockWorld problem there are a lot of overlapping path reaching a node so it makes sense to use GraphSearch and keep track of what nodes have been expanded already so that they are not expanded again. \n"
